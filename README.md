# 🐔 Kukhuri-Ka: Play, Learn, and Grow Together

## 💡 Project Overview & Problem Definition

### Problem
The early childhood education space (ages 4–8) often lacks **engaging, curriculum-aligned, and safe digital learning tools** that seamlessly integrate literacy, numeracy, and essential social-emotional skills. Existing platforms may be too fragmented, difficult for pre-readers to navigate, or fail to provide transparent progress tracking for parents and educators aligned with standardized Early Childhood Development (ECD) curricula.

### Project Goals
The primary goal is to develop a fun, safe, and interactive gamified learning platform for children aged 4–8 that enhances core skills (literacy, numeracy, creativity) and is:
1.  **Curriculum-Aligned:** Directly mapped to Early Childhood Development (ECD) curriculum standards.
2.  **Child-Centric:** Features a child-friendly UI/UX, colorful animations, and strong narration for pre-readers.
3.  **Safe & Compliant:** Adheres to stringent data privacy and child protection standards (COPPA/GDPR-K).
