# 🐔 Kukhuri-Ka: Play, Learn, and Grow Together

## 💡 Project Overview & Problem Definition

### Problem
The early childhood education space (ages 4–8) often lacks **engaging, curriculum-aligned, and safe digital learning tools** that seamlessly integrate literacy, numeracy, and essential social-emotional skills. Existing platforms may be too fragmented, difficult for pre-readers to navigate, or fail to provide transparent progress tracking for parents and educators aligned with standardized Early Childhood Development (ECD) curricula.

### Project Goals
The primary goal is to develop a fun, safe, and interactive gamified learning platform for children aged 4–8 that enhances core skills (literacy, numeracy, creativity) and is:
1.  **Curriculum-Aligned:** Directly mapped to Early Childhood Development (ECD) curriculum standards.
2.  **Child-Centric:** Features a child-friendly UI/UX, colorful animations, and strong narration for pre-readers.
3.  **Safe & Compliant:** Adheres to stringent data privacy and child protection standards (COPPA/GDPR-K).

## ✨ Core Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)

To ensure a functional and high-quality product within the 6-week timeline, the MVP will focus on the core system and two introductory activities (Age 4 & 5).

| Feature Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Gamified Learning Modules** | Implementation of **Alphabet Adventure (Age 4)** and **Word Builder (Age 5)**. |
| **Rewards System** | Functioning logic for tracking points, unlocking badges, and displaying stars. |
| **Child-Friendly Interface** | Intuitive UI/UX with full audio narration and visual cues for pre-readers. |
| **Parent Dashboard (MVP)** | A secure view for adults to track the child’s progress and scores for the implemented Age 4/5 games. |
| **Privacy & Safety** | Built-in mechanisms to ensure a safe, advertising-free, and privacy-compliant environment (COPPA/GDPR-K). |

## 🐍 Week 2: Python Implementation (Math Safari)

For this week's assignment, we have developed a functional Python script that serves as the logic engine for the "Age 4-5 Numeracy" module of Kukhuri-Ka.

### 📂 File Configuration
* **`math_safari.py`**: The core Python script containing the game logic.
* **`README.md`**: Updated to include technical specifications and team contributions.

### 🛠️ Technical Features
* **Dynamic Logic:** Uses the `random` module to generate unique addition puzzles every time the game is played.
* **Error Handling:** Includes `try-except` blocks and input validation to ensure the program doesn't crash if a user enters non-numeric data.
* **User Experience:** Integrated the `time` module to create natural pauses, making the text-based interface more child-friendly.
* **Gamification:** A tracking system that tallies "Bananas" (points) and awards a "Gold Chicken Badge" for perfect scores.

### 👥 Team Contributions (Week 2)
* **Saksham Subedi (Team Manager):** Initial script architecture and GitHub workflow management.
* **Ayush Hamal (Developer):** Implemented core math logic, random generator, and scoring system.
* **Oshin Thapa Magar (Documentation & QA):** Finalized the `README.md` technical documentation and verified the code's error-handling capabilities.
